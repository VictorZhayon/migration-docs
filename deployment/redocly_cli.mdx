  <Step title="Step 2" icon="arrow-down" iconType="solid" titleSize="h3">
    You can install it [globally](../../cli/installation#install-globally) using npm.

    Or you can install it during [runtime](../../cli/installation#use-npx-at-runtime) using npx or Docker.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Build the HTML file

The Redocly CLI `build-docs` command builds Redoc into an HTML file.

To build an HTML file using Redocly CLI, enter the following command, replacing `apis/openapi.yaml` with your API definition file's name and path:

```bash
redocly build-docs apis/openapi.yaml
```

See the [build-docs](../../cli/commands/build-docs) documentation for more information on the different options and ways you can use the command.

Also, check out [Redocly CLI commands](../../cli/commands) for more information on the different things you can do with Redocly CLI including linting, splitting, and bundling your API definition file.
