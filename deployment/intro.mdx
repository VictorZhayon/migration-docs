# Redoc deployment guide

Redoc offers multiple options for rendering your OpenAPI definition.
You should select the option that best fits your needs.

## Deployment Options

- **[Live demo](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/)**  
  The live demo offers a fast way to see how your OpenAPI renders with Redoc.
  A version of the Swagger Petstore API is displayed by default. To test it with your own OpenAPI definition, enter the URL for your
  definition and select **TRY IT**.

- **[HTML element](./html)**  
  Using the HTML element works well for typical website deployments.

- **[React component](./react)**  
  Using the React component is an option for users with a React-based application.

- **[Docker image](./docker)**  
  Using the Docker image works in a container-based deployment.

- **[Redocly CLI](./cli)**  
  Using the Redocly CLI is an option for users who prefer to use a command-line interface.

## Before you start

### OpenAPI definition

You need an OpenAPI definition. For testing purposes, you can use one of the following sample OpenAPI definitions:

<Tabs items={['OpenAPI 3.0', 'OpenAPI 2.0']}>
  <Tab>
    - [Museum Example API](https://github.com/Redocly/museum-openapi-example/blob/main/openapi.yaml)
    - [Petstore Sample OpenAPI Definition](https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json)
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - [Thingful OpenAPI Definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingful/openapi-spec/master/spec/swagger.yaml)
    - [Fitbit Plus OpenAPI Definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TwineHealth/TwineDeveloperDocs/master/spec/swagger.yaml)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  **OpenAPI specification**  
  For more information on the OpenAPI specification, refer to the [Learning OpenAPI 3](https://redocly.com/docs/resources/learning-openapi/)
  section in the documentation.
</Callout>

### How to run Redoc locally

If you want to view your Redoc output locally, you can simulate an HTTP server.

<Tabs items={['Python', 'Node.js']}>
  <Tab>
    If you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```

    If you have [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed:
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    ```

    The output after entering the command provides the local URL where the preview can be accessed.
    To exit the preview, use `control-C`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed:
    ```bash
    # Install http-server globally
    npm install -g http-server

    # Start the server
    http-server
    ```

    The output after entering the command provides the local URL where the preview can be accessed.
    To exit the preview, use `control-C`.
